User query: Where is a red pen?
LLM answer: Based on the query "Where is a red pen?", I select object with id 27.{    "explanation": "I choose object with id 27 because there is no object in the JSON with description containing the word'red'. The descriptions of the objects in the JSON are 'Blue and brown pen.' for both objects, which does not match the query. Therefore, I select the object that is most likely to be related to the query, which is object with id 27.",    "id": 27}
