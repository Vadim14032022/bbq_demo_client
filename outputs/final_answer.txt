User query: Are there a pen?
LLM answer: Based on the query "Are there a pen?", I select object with id 24.{    "explanation": "I choose object with id 24 because it's a 'blue marker', which is a type of writing instrument, and the query is asking if there is a pen. Although the query doesn't explicitly mention 'blue marker', it's a reasonable assumption that a 'pen' could refer to any type of writing instrument, including a marker.",    "id": 24}
